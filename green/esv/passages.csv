TSOM61,Matthew 6:13,"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. "
TSOM62,Matthew 6:14,"For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, "

TSOM72,Matthew 6:24,"&ldquo;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. "
TSOM73,Matthew 6:25,"&ldquo;Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? "
TSOM74,Matthew 6:26,"Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? "
TSOM75,Matthew 6:27,And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? 
TSOM76,Matthew 6:28,"And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, "
TSOM77,Matthew 6:29,"yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. "

TSOM80,Matthew 6:32,"For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. "
TSOM81,Matthew 6:33,"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. "
TSOM82,Matthew 6:34,"&ldquo;Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. "
TSOM83,Matthew 7:1,"&ldquo;Judge not, that you be not judged. "
TSOM84,Matthew 7:2,"For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. "
TSOM85,Matthew 7:3,"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? "
TSOM86,Matthew 7:4,"Or how can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&rsquo; when there is the log in your own eye? "

TSOM90,Matthew 7:8,"For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. "
TSOM91,Matthew 7:9,"Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? "

TSOM93,Matthew 7:11,"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! "
TSOM94,Matthew 7:12,"&ldquo;So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. "
TSOM95,Matthew 7:13,"&ldquo;Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. "
TSOM96,Matthew 7:14,"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. "
TSOM97,Matthew 7:15,"&ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. "
TSOM98,Matthew 7:16,"You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? "

TPOTS7,Mark 4:7,"Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. "
