"TSOM17","Matthew 5:17","&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t assume that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill."
"TSOM18","Matthew 5:18","For I assure you: Until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all things are accomplished."
"TSOM19","Matthew 5:19","Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

"TSOM27","Matthew 5:27","&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, Do not commit adultery."
"TSOM28","Matthew 5:28","But I tell you, everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

"TSOM34","Matthew 5:34","But I tell you, don&rsquo;t take an oath at all: either by heaven, because it is God&rsquo;s throne;"
"TSOM35","Matthew 5:35","or by the earth, because it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King."
"TSOM36","Matthew 5:36","Neither should you swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black."
"TSOM37","Matthew 5:37","But let your word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; be &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and your &lsquo;no&rsquo; be &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Anything more than this is from the evil one."

"TSOM43","Matthew 5:43","&ldquo;You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
"TSOM44","Matthew 5:44","But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"
"TSOM45","Matthew 5:45","so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."
"TSOM46","Matthew 5:46","For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don&rsquo;t even the tax collectors do the same?"
"TSOM47","Matthew 5:47","And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing out of the ordinary? Don&rsquo;t even the Gentiles do the same?"
"TSOM48","Matthew 5:48","Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
"TSOM49","Matthew 6:1","&ldquo;Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people, to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
"TSOM50","Matthew 6:2","So whenever you give to the poor, don&rsquo;t sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be applauded by people. I assure you: They&rsquo;ve got their reward!"
"TSOM51","Matthew 6:3","But when you give to the poor, don&rsquo;t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
"TSOM52","Matthew 6:4","so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
"TSOM53","Matthew 6:5","&ldquo;Whenever you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. I assure you: They&rsquo;ve got their reward!"
"TSOM54","Matthew 6:6","But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
"TSOM55","Matthew 6:7","When you pray, don&rsquo;t babble like the idolaters, since they imagine they&rsquo;ll be heard for their many words."
"TSOM56","Matthew 6:8","Don&rsquo;t be like them, because your Father knows the things you need before you ask Him."
"TSOM57","Matthew 6:9","&ldquo;Therefore, you should pray like this: Our Father in heaven, Your name be honored as holy."
"TSOM58","Matthew 6:10","Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
"TSOM59","Matthew 6:11","Give us today our daily bread."
"TSOM60","Matthew 6:12","And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
"TSOM61","Matthew 6:13","And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."
"TSOM62","Matthew 6:14","&ldquo;For if you forgive people their wrongdoing, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well."
"TSOM63","Matthew 6:15","But if you don&rsquo;t forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoing."
"TSOM64","Matthew 6:16","&ldquo;Whenever you fast, don&rsquo;t be sad-faced like the hypocrites. For they make their faces unattractive so their fasting is obvious to people. I assure you: They&rsquo;ve got their reward!"
"TSOM65","Matthew 6:17","But when you fast, put oil on your head, and wash your face,"
"TSOM66","Matthew 6:18","so that you don&rsquo;t show your fasting to people but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
"TSOM67","Matthew 6:19","&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t collect for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal."
"TSOM68","Matthew 6:20","But collect for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don&rsquo;t break in and steal."
"TSOM69","Matthew 6:21","For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
"TSOM70","Matthew 6:22","&ldquo;The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light."
"TSOM71","Matthew 6:23","But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light within you is darkness &mdash; how deep is that darkness!"
"TSOM72","Matthew 6:24","&ldquo;No one can be a slave of two masters, since either he will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves of God and of money."
"TSOM73","Matthew 6:25","&ldquo;This is why I tell you: Don&rsquo;t worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn&rsquo;t life more than food and the body more than clothing?"
"TSOM74","Matthew 6:26","Look at the birds of the sky: They don&rsquo;t sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren&rsquo;t you worth more than they?"
"TSOM75","Matthew 6:27","Can any of you add a single cubit to his height by worrying?"
"TSOM76","Matthew 6:28","And why do you worry about clothes? Learn how the wildflowers of the field grow: they don&rsquo;t labor or spin thread."
"TSOM77","Matthew 6:29","Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these!"
"TSOM78","Matthew 6:30","If that&rsquo;s how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won&rsquo;t He do much more for you &mdash; you of little faith?"
"TSOM79","Matthew 6:31","So don&rsquo;t worry, saying, &lsquo;What will we eat? &rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we drink? &rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we wear? &rsquo;"
"TSOM80","Matthew 6:32","For the idolaters eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them."
"TSOM81","Matthew 6:33","But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you."
"TSOM82","Matthew 6:34","Therefore don&rsquo;t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
"TSOM83","Matthew 7:1","&ldquo;Do not judge, so that you won&rsquo;t be judged."
"TSOM84","Matthew 7:2","For with the judgment you use, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
"TSOM85","Matthew 7:3","Why do you look at the speck in your brother&rsquo;s eye but don&rsquo;t notice the log in your own eye?"
"TSOM86","Matthew 7:4","Or how can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Let me take the speck out of your eye,&rsquo; and look, there&rsquo;s a log in your eye?"
"TSOM87","Matthew 7:5","Hypocrite! First take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother&rsquo;s eye."
"TSOM88","Matthew 7:6","Don&rsquo;t give what is holy to dogs or toss your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them with their feet, turn, and tear you to pieces."
"TSOM89","Matthew 7:7","&ldquo;Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you."
"TSOM90","Matthew 7:8","For everyone who asks receives, and the one who searches finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."
"TSOM91","Matthew 7:9","What man among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?"
"TSOM92","Matthew 7:10","Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?"
"TSOM93","Matthew 7:11","If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
"TSOM94","Matthew 7:12","Therefore, whatever you want others to do for you, do also the same for them &mdash; this is the Law and the Prophets."
"TSOM95","Matthew 7:13","&ldquo;Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it."
"TSOM96","Matthew 7:14","How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it."
"TSOM97","Matthew 7:15","&ldquo;Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves."
"TSOM98","Matthew 7:16","You&rsquo;ll recognize them by their fruit. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles?"
"TSOM99","Matthew 7:17","In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit."
"TSOM100","Matthew 7:18","A good tree can&rsquo;t produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit."
"TSOM101","Matthew 7:19","Every tree that doesn&rsquo;t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
"TSOM102","Matthew 7:20","So you&rsquo;ll recognize them by their fruit."
"TSOM103","Matthew 7:21","&ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord! &rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of My Father in heaven."
"TSOM104","Matthew 7:22","On that day many will say to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, didn&rsquo;t we prophesy in Your name, drive out demons in Your name, and do many miracles in Your name? &rsquo;"
"TSOM105","Matthew 7:23","Then I will announce to them, &lsquo;I never knew you! Depart from Me, you lawbreakers!&rsquo;"
"TSOM106","Matthew 7:24","&ldquo;Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on the rock."
"TSOM107","Matthew 7:25","The rain fell, the rivers rose, and the winds blew and pounded that house. Yet it didn&rsquo;t collapse, because its foundation was on the rock."
"TSOM108","Matthew 7:26","But everyone who hears these words of Mine and doesn&rsquo;t act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand."
"TSOM109","Matthew 7:27","The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house, and it collapsed. And its collapse was great! &rdquo;"
"TSOM110","Matthew 7:28","When Jesus had finished this sermon, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,"
"TSOM111","Matthew 7:29","because He was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes."
"TPOTS1","Mark 4:1","Again He began to teach by the sea, and a very large crowd gathered around Him. So He got into a boat on the sea and sat down, while the whole crowd was on the shore facing the sea."
"TPOTS2","Mark 4:2","He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them:"
"TPOTS3","Mark 4:3","&ldquo;Listen! Consider the sower who went out to sow."
"TPOTS4","Mark 4:4","As he sowed, this occurred: Some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up."
"TPOTS5","Mark 4:5","Other seed fell on rocky ground where it didn&rsquo;t have much soil, and it sprang up right away, since it didn&rsquo;t have deep soil."
"TPOTS6","Mark 4:6","When the sun came up, it was scorched, and since it didn&rsquo;t have a root, it withered."
"TPOTS7","Mark 4:7","Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it didn&rsquo;t produce a crop."
"TPOTS8","Mark 4:8","Still others fell on good ground and produced a crop that increased 30, 60, and 100 times what was sown.&rdquo;"
"TPOTS9","Mark 4:9","Then He said, &ldquo;Anyone who has ears to hear should listen! &rdquo;"
"TPOTS10","Mark 4:10","When He was alone with the Twelve, those who were around Him asked Him about the parables."
"TPOTS11","Mark 4:11","He answered them, &ldquo;The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables"
"TPOTS12","Mark 4:12","so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back &mdash; and be forgiven.&rdquo;"
"TPOTS13","Mark 4:13","Then He said to them: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any of the parables?"
"TPOTS14","Mark 4:14","The sower sows the word."
"TPOTS15","Mark 4:15","These are the ones along the path where the word is sown: when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word sown in them."

"TPOTS18","Mark 4:18","Others are sown among thorns; these are the ones who hear the word,"
"TPOTS19","Mark 4:19","but the worries of this age, the seduction of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
"TPOTS20","Mark 4:20","But the ones sown on good ground are those who hear the word, welcome it, and produce a crop: 30, 60, and 100 times what was sown.&rdquo;"

"JAN1","John 3:1","There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."
"JAN2","John 3:2","This man came to Him at night and said, &ldquo;Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one could perform these signs You do unless God were with him.&rdquo;"
"JAN3","John 3:3","Jesus replied, &ldquo;I assure you: Unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;"
"JAN4","John 3:4","&ldquo;But how can anyone be born when he is old? &rdquo; Nicodemus asked Him. &ldquo;Can he enter his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time and be born? &rdquo;"
"JAN5","John 3:5","Jesus answered, &ldquo;I assure you: Unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

"JAN14","John 3:14","Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,"
"JAN15","John 3:15","so that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life."
"JAN16","John 3:16","&ldquo;For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life."
"JAN17","John 3:17","For God did not send His Son into the world that He might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him."
"JAN18","John 3:18","Anyone who believes in Him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God."
"JAN19","John 3:19","&ldquo;This, then, is the judgment: The light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil."

"TC4","John 19:4","Pilate went outside again and said to them, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m bringing Him outside to you to let you know I find no grounds for charging Him.&rdquo;"
"TC5","John 19:5","Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Here is the man! &rdquo;"
"TC6","John 19:6","When the chief priests and the temple police saw Him, they shouted, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify! &rdquo; Pilate responded, &ldquo;Take Him and crucify Him yourselves, for I find no grounds for charging Him.&rdquo;"

"TC8","John 19:8","When Pilate heard this statement, he was more afraid than ever."
"TC9","John 19:9","He went back into the headquarters and asked Jesus, &ldquo;Where are You from? &rdquo; But Jesus did not give him an answer."
"TC10","John 19:10","So Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not talking to me? Don&rsquo;t You know that I have the authority to release You and the authority to crucify You? &rdquo;"
"TC11","John 19:11","&ldquo;You would have no authority over Me at all,&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been given you from above. This is why the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.&rdquo;"
"TC12","John 19:12","From that moment Pilate made every effort to release Him. But the Jews shouted, &ldquo;If you release this man, you are not Caesar&rsquo;s friend. Anyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar! &rdquo;"

"TC20","John 19:20","Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek."
"TC21","John 19:21","So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but that He said, &lsquo;I am the King of the Jews.&rsquo; &rdquo;"
"TC22","John 19:22","Pilate replied, &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;"
"TC23","John 19:23","When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took His clothes and divided them into four parts, a part for each soldier. They also took the tunic, which was seamless, woven in one piece from the top."

"TC30","John 19:30","When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, &ldquo;It is finished! &rdquo; Then bowing His head, He gave up His spirit."
"TC31","John 19:31","Since it was the preparation day, the Jews did not want the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special day). They requested that Pilate have the men&rsquo;s legs broken and that their bodies be taken away."
"TC32","John 19:32","So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been crucified with Him."

"TC36","John 19:36","For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: Not one of His bones will be broken."
"TC37","John 19:37","Also, another Scripture says: They will look at the One they pierced."
"TC38","John 19:38","After this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus &mdash; but secretly because of his fear of the Jews &mdash; asked Pilate that he might remove Jesus&rsquo; body. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and took His body away."
