"Matthew 6:25","“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?"
"Matthew 6:26","Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
"Matthew 6:27","Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?"
"Matthew 6:28","“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin."
"Matthew 6:29","Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these."
"Matthew 6:30","If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?"
"Matthew 6:31","So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’"
"Matthew 6:32","For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them."

"Matthew 7:8","For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."
"Matthew 7:9","“Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?"
"Matthew 7:10","Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?"
"Matthew 7:11","If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!"
"Matthew 7:12","So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
"Matthew 7:13","“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it."
"Matthew 7:14","But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."
"Matthew 7:15","“Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves."
"Matthew 7:16","By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?"
"Matthew 7:17","Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit."
"Matthew 7:18","A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit."
"Matthew 7:19","Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
"Matthew 7:20","Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them."
"Matthew 7:21","“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
"Matthew 7:22","Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’"
"Matthew 7:23","Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’"
"Matthew 7:24","“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
"Matthew 7:25","The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock."
"Matthew 7:26","But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand."
"Matthew 7:27","The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”"
"Matthew 7:28","When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,"
"Matthew 7:29","because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law."
"Mark 4:1","Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge."
"Mark 4:2","He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:"
"Mark 4:3","“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed."
"Mark 4:4","As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up."
"Mark 4:5","Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow."
"Mark 4:6","But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root."
"Mark 4:7","Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain."
"Mark 4:8","Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”"
"Mark 4:9","Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”"
"Mark 4:10","When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables."
"Mark 4:11","He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables"
"Mark 4:12","so that, “‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’”"
"Mark 4:13","Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?"
"Mark 4:14","The farmer sows the word."
"Mark 4:15","Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them."
"Mark 4:16","Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy."
"Mark 4:17","But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away."
"Mark 4:18","Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;"
"Mark 4:19","but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful."
"Mark 4:20","Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”"
"Luke 22:15","And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."
"Luke 22:16","For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”"
"Luke 22:17","After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you."
"Luke 22:18","For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”"
"Luke 22:19","And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”"
"Luke 22:20","In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."
"John 3:1","Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council."
"John 3:2","He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”"
"John 3:3","Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”"
"John 3:4","“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”"
"John 3:5","Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit."
"John 3:6","Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit."
"John 3:7","You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’"
"John 3:8","The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”"
"John 3:9","“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked."
"John 3:10","“You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things?"
"John 3:11","Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony."
"John 3:12","I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?"
"John 3:13","No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man."
"John 3:14","Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,"
"John 3:15","that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”"
"John 3:16","For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
"John 3:17","For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."
"John 3:18","Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son."
"John 3:19","This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil."
"John 3:20","Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed."
"John 3:21","But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."
"John 19:1","Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged."
"John 19:2","The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe"
"John 19:3","and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they slapped him in the face."
"John 19:4","Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”"
"John 19:5","When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”"
"John 19:6","As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.”"
"John 19:7","The Jewish leaders insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.”"
"John 19:8","When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,"
"John 19:9","and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer."
"John 19:10","“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?”"
"John 19:11","Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”"
"John 19:12","From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”"
"John 19:13","When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha)."
"John 19:14","It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.  “Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews."
"John 19:15","But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” “Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked.  “We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered."
"John 19:16","Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.  So the soldiers took charge of Jesus."
"John 19:17","Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha)."
"John 19:18","There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle."
"John 19:19","Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews."
"John 19:20","Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek."
"John 19:21","The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”"
"John 19:22","Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”"
"John 19:23","When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom."
"John 19:24","“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.” This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, “They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.” So this is what the soldiers did."
"John 19:25","Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
"John 19:26","When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Woman, here is your son,”"
"John 19:27","and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took her into his home."

"John 19:30","When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."
"John 19:31","Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down."
"John 19:32","The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other."
"John 19:33","But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs."
"John 19:34","Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water."
"John 19:35","The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe."
"John 19:36","These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”"
"John 19:37","and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”"
"John 19:38","Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away."
"John 19:39","He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds."
"John 19:40","Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs."
"John 19:41","At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid."
